# Setup your environment

This is an Expo project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). This project uses the expo development build. You will need to make sure you setup your environment correctly and be prepared before the interview. You should be able to start this project.

When the interview process starts we will share a zip folder with you that contains `task` folder needs to be added to this project. Your folder structure after the provided zips are dropped into the project should look like this.

```
android/
app/
assets/
common/
ios/
tasks/
```

The `app` folder will just contain the navigation layout and all the work that needs to be done is inside the `tasks` folder.
